# Ownable Smart Contract

This is an example Starknet smart contract written in Cairo to showcase how to perform different types of integration tests with Protostar.

To run the test suite of this project, you are going to need to first install Scarb (compiler and package manager) and then [install Protostar](https://docs.swmansion.com/protostar/docs/cairo-1/installation) (test runner).
