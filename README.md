# Ownable Smart Contract

This is an example Starknet smart contract written in Cairo 1 to showcase how to perform different types of integration tests with Protostar.

To run the test suite of this project you'll need to install [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/install) (compiler and package manager) and [Protostar](https://docs.swmansion.com/protostar/docs/cairo-1/installation) (test runner).

Once those dependencies are installed you'll be able to run the test suite by executing the following command on the terminal:

```
protostar test
```
